|  **I am a digital humanist working on the border of technology and culture.** <br> As a teacher, researcher, developer and writer, I am interested in exploring complex relationship between technology and culture. I have worked for the last four years helping non-traditional and underrepresented students at Seattle University in a Digital Technology and Cultures program explore social science, philosophy, composition and software development. I've also worked to help bridge the digital divide as volunteer teacher and writing consultant for the EchoX program. My current passion in teaching is exploring the potential of online education and education in extended reality. In 2019, I was awarded a grant to apply pedagogical principles to virtual reality. | ![Profile Icon](/img/avatar.png) |
